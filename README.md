# Social Network API
## Description
MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. In this application, I have built an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. This app uses a mongoDB database and the Mongoose ODM, as well as Express.js is used for routing.
